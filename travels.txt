Japan is my favorite place to travel.
I love eating sushi– really all of the cuisine because I'm lactose-intolerant and much of the food is made without dairy.
Japanese culture is highly respectable–the elegance, ornateness, and attention to detail.
The landscape is beautiful with forests, mountains, and beaches. 
The citizens keep public spaces clean for everyone to enjoy. I don't think I saw a single piece of litter.
